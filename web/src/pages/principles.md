NexaJS is the product of __1000s of hours__ and over __3+ years__ of iterative development across __4 blockchains__ _(namely BTC, ETH, BCH & NEXA)._ A great deal of thought and consideration goes into every line of code contained in this library.

## ECMAScript Modules (ESM)

NexaJS uses modern ESM to ensure compatiblitiy with ALL modern tooling available to JS developers.

### CommonJS Compatibility

There are currently NO plans to add CJS support to NexaJS.

## JavaScript Classes

Although not stricly necessary, JS Classes offer a familiarity to non-JS developers that often makes the transition to JS development less challenging.

### Event Emitters

Used to broadcast real-time events across the Library.

## Tailwind CSS

This is a mature CSS library that offers great support and regular updates from its team.
