 * compressed form of the derived public key (33 bytes, beginning with `0x02` or
 * `0x03`) on the respective network.
 * - The less common `mainnet-uncompressed` and `testnet-uncompressed` values
 * indicate that the address should use the uncompressed form of the public key
 * (65 bytes beginning with `0x04`) on the specified network.

 * payload prior to encoding. For the uncompressed construction, the extra byte
