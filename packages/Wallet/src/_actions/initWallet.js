     * Status codes:
     *     active: Session address is ready to receive OR spend funds.
     *     disabled: Already received and spent funds (MUST be empty).
     *     locked: Session address is reserved OR has received funds currently
     *             being held in reserve for a later use.
     *             (eg. CashShuffle, CashFusion, ANYONECANPAY, etc)
     *
     * NOTE: Reserved paths are used to "freeze" coins, for use with
